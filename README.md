## **Python tools to solve typical computational biology problems.**

This project aims to create a practical python toolbox to ease exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling and visualization of biological data; an all-in-one expandable package.

In an attempt to take in as much biological research fields requiring computational tools as possible, I will develop the tools based on books and journal articles that will be listed below.

## Index (modules and classes)
- biostrings
	- indexing
	- alignment
- apis
- modeling:
	- StoichMat
	- graphs
- util:
	- algorithms
## TO DO
- indexing
	- suffix array matching
	- burrows wheeler transformation
- alignment
	- genome graphs:
		- string graphs
		- k-mer graphs
